# GalenDoist
Makes my Todoist life better!

The title is a terrible portmanteau of the words "**G**oogle C**alen**dar" and "Tod**oist**". It'll probably change. Hopefully.

## Features
---------
- Automatically syncs between GCal Calendars and Todoist Projects with same name
- Synced tasks now END at the due time instead of START at the due time
- If a task has the `@planning` label and a due time or date, automatically get rid of the label
- Tasks with the `@assignment` label now are automatically turned into "sections". Three new tasks to work on it are then formed with the due dates automatically assigned to be the three days preceding the due date. The assignment is then given the "planned" label to signify this action, and then I can modify the tasks however I want
- Assignments are automatically given a due date, based on their date and corresponding project
