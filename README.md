# Sanity for Todoist
Makes my Todoist life better!

## Features
---------
- Syncs between GCal Calendars and Todoist Projects with same name
- Synced tasks now END at the due time instead of START at the due time
- If a task has the `@planning` label and a due time, automatically get rid of the label
- Tasks with certain projects or labels will automatically have preset reminders
